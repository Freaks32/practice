 * MatrixPaths Problem
 * https://www.careercup.com/question?id=8248228
 * <p>
 * Given a MxN matrix, find the total number of possible paths from top-left to bottom-right element,
 * you can go rightwards and downwards only. Now, assume some of the entries in the matrix are blocked,
 * find the number of such paths. For example: For a 3X3 matrix, total number of paths is 6.
 * For second case, if we block entry (2,2), we have only 2 paths available.
