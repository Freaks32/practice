 * Given an NxN grid with an array of lamp coordinates.
 * Each lamp provides illumination to every square on their x axis,
 * every square on their y axis, and every square that lies in their
 * diagonal (think of a Queen in chess).
 * <p>
 * Given an array of query coordinates,
 * determine whether that point is illuminated or not.
 * The catch is when checking a query all lamps adjacent to, or on,â€¦
