 * <p>
 * There is an island which is represented by square matrix NxN.
 * A person on the island is standing at any given co-ordinates (x,y).
 * He can move in any direction one step right, left, up, down on the island.
 * If he steps outside the island, he dies.
 * <p>
 * Let island is represented as (0,0) to (N-1,N-1) (i.e NxN matrix) & person
 * is standing at given co-ordinates (x,y).
 * He is allowed to move n steps on the island (along the matrix).
 * What is the probability that he is alive after he walks n steps on the island?
 * <p>
 * Write a psuedocode & then full code for function
 * float probabilityofalive(int x,int y, int n)
