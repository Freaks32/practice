 * Given a 2-D matrix represents the room, obstacle and guard like
 * the following (0 is room, B->obstacle, G-> Guard):
 * 0 0 0
 * B G G
 * B 0 0
 * <p>
 * calculate the steps from a room to nearest Guard
 * and set the matrix, like this
 * 2 1 1
 * B G G
 * B 1 1
 * Write the algorithm, with optimal solution.
