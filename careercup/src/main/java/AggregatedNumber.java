/**
 * AggregatedNumber
 * https://careercup.com/question?id=14948278
 * <p>
 * we will name a number "aggregated number" if this number
 * has the following attribute (just like the Fibonacci numbers):
 * 1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....
 * <p>
 * the digits in the number can divided into several parts,
 * and the later part is the sum of the former parts.
 * <p>
 * like 112358, because 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8
 * 122436, because 12+24=36
 * 1299111210, because 12+99=111, 99+111=210
 * 112112224, because 112+112=224
 * so can you provide a function to check whether this number is aggregated number or not?
